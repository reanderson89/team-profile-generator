  ## **Description**
  This is a CLI based application that allows the user to dynamically create an HTML page styled with bootstrap. After cloning the repository, running 'npm install", and then entering 'node app.js' the user will be prompted with questions first for the manager. After completing those prompts they will be prompted to add other employees or choose that they are all done. Each employee has 3 of the same questions (name, id, email) and then 1 different one(office, school, github). When the user is done entering their employees information they can write the HTML page by selecting 'No thank you' when prompted to add another team member.
